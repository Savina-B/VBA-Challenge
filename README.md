VBA-Challenge analysing stocks for one year

The Excel sheet attached shows an analysis of stock data.

In columns I, J, K, L the following have been printed/calculated respectively: ticker symbol, yearly change, percentage change and total volume. Conditional formatting has been applied to show positive and negative percentage changes.

In columns O, P and Q the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease and greatest total volume have been printed/calculated.

Part of the challenge was to loop the script through worksheets, which I was unable to do.

Aid was received from Tutor, research on StackOverflow and research from previous similar examples.Â
