# VBA-Challenge
In this project, I utilised VBA scripting to analyse generated stock market data for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020.  

The Excel sheet screenshots attached below shows an analysis of stock data.

The Excel Workbook and the VBA Script have also been attached.

In columns I, J, K, L the following have been printed/calculated respectively: ticker symbol, yearly change, percentage change and total volume. Conditional formatting has been applied to show positive and negative percentage changes.

In columns O, P and Q the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease and greatest total volume have been printed/calculated.
